# Markdown Editor Application Challenge

## Overview

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Markdown Editor application using React, TypeScript, and the Lexical editor framework. This application will provide users with the capability to upload Markdown files, edit them in a rich text environment, preview the changes in real-time, and download the edited content. This project aims to assess your proficiency in handling file operations, integrating third-party libraries, and crafting intuitive, user-friendly interfaces.

## Objectives
1. **File Upload**: Implement a functionality that allows users to upload Markdown (.md) files. The content of these files should be automatically loaded into the editor for editing.
2. **Markdown Editing**: Utilize the Lexical editor to enable rich text editing of the Markdown content. Ensure that common Markdown syntax (e.g., headings, bold, italic, lists) is supported.
3. **Content Preview**: Provide a live preview feature where users can see how the edited Markdown renders, facilitating a seamless editing experience.
4. **Download Functionality**: Allow users to download their edited Markdown content as a .md file, preserving their changes.

## Requirements
- **Framework**: Use React, initialized with Create React App for simplicity.
- **Language**: Develop the application using TypeScript to ensure type safety and enhance code quality.
- **Editor Library**: Integrate Facebook's Lexical editor for the Markdown editing functionality.
- **Styling**: Employ CSS or any CSS-in-JS library to style the application. Aim for a clean, accessible, and responsive design.
- **File Operations**: Implement robust mechanisms for uploading and downloading Markdown files.

## Deliverables
- **Source Code**: A link to a GitHub repository containing your project code, complete with a detailed `README.md`. This README should contain instructions on how to set up and run your application, an overview of the project's structure, and any significant design decisions.
- **Live Demo** (Optional): If possible, deploy your application to a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) and include a link to the live version in your README.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Functionality**: The application meets all the listed objectives and works as expected without significant bugs.
- **Code Quality**: The project demonstrates clean, well-organized, and maintainable code practices. Use of TypeScript should enhance the project's reliability and readability.
- **User Interface and Experience**: The application is easy to use, with a straightforward workflow for uploading, editing, and downloading documents. The design should be visually appealing and responsive across devices.
- **Creativity and Innovation**: Additional features, creative solutions to common problems, or particularly elegant implementations will be viewed favorably.
