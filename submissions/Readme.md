# Submissions Directory

## Overview

This directory is dedicated to hosting the submissions for our coding challenges. Each submission should be placed in its own unique subdirectory to ensure that all applicants' work is organized and easily accessible.

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the main repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create Your Submission Directory**: Within the `submissions` folder, create a new directory for your submission. The directory should be named using your GitHub username or a combination of your name and the submission date (YYYY-MM-DD). For example, `john_doe_2023-03-15`.

3. **Add Your Project**: Inside your unique submission directory, add the entire project for the challenge you completed. This includes all source code, a dedicated README with setup and run instructions, and any other necessary files.

4. **Document Your Work**: Ensure your project includes a README.md file that explains your application, how to set it up, run it, and any other relevant information about your submission.

5. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Once you have added your project to your fork of the repository, create a pull request to merge your submission into the main repository. In your PR, provide a brief overview of your solution and any other comments you wish to add.

## Review Process

Our team will review each submission individually. We appreciate your patience during this process. Feedback will be provided through the GitHub PR comments.

## Questions?

If you have any questions about the submission process or face any issues, please feel free to open an issue in the main repository or contact us directly via tech@autoya.de

Thank you for participating in our challenge. We look forward to reviewing your innovative solutions!
