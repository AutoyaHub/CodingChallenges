def process_documents(documents: List[str], 
                     max_threads: int = 4) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Process a list of documents with parallel execution.
    
    Args:
        documents: List of document paths to process
        max_threads: Maximum number of worker threads

        Dictionary containing processing results or None if failed
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If documents list is empty
        ProcessingError: If document processing fails
    """
    if not documents:
        raise ValueError("Documents list cannot be empty")
    
    logger.info(f"Processing {len(documents)} documents with {max_threads} threads")
    
    # Your implementation here...
    return results
```
